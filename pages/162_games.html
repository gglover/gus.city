<p>
  This site breaks the MLB season down into series-by-series segments and graphs
  those results over time. Gauging a team's performance through this lens allows
  one to see through much of the noise in 162 individual results.
  <em>Winning the series</em> is usually read as a more important indicator of
  sustainable success.

  Additionally, I've included a rough measure of the team's momentum at the time
  the series took place. The aim is to easily address a common fan question:
  <em>"Did we play this team at a good or bad time?"</em>
</p>

<p>
  The data is sourced from
  <a href="https://statsapi.mlb.com/docs/">MLB's official stats API</a> using
  <a href="https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI">python bindings</a>. I use
  a Lambda to refresh the results every night during the regular season. The
  responses are condensed into a single ~400KB JSON file that contains series,
  results, rankings, and measures of momentum for every team across every day in
  the season.

<p>I chose D3, React, Tanstack Router, and Vite as my frontend stack.</p>
