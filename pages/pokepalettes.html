A simple, one-page site that breaks down the color palettes used in pokemon sprites.
Some designers have told me that they use it for inspiration. Most people just visit to get blasted with pretty colors.

I originally built this in my college dorm to learn jQuery. A few years later I refined the idea and rewrote the site in backbone.js. This was before
<code>image-rendering: pixelated;</code> was widely supported in the CSS spec so I expand the 96x96 png sprites pixel-by-pixel onto a
<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element.

I wanted to creating something smooth, performant, and fun to use. I was blessed to ride the algorithm all the way to the Reddit front page
and earned a few write-ups as a result.
