Arcsine Imaging was a hybrid software-photography studio I started with my good friend Dustin. We built an optimized 3D format for
rendering physical objects the web. Here's a sample:

<p>
Before starting the venture, we spent six years collectively in the augmented reality space. We we're frustrated by the low fidelity graphics,
awkward wearables, and lack of clear product vision in that industry. We wanted to build something more tangible.
</p>

<p>
We built the embeddable 3D viewer and asset pipeline from scratch to support dynamically project photo textures. It is completely outside of a 
traditional PBR material workflow.
</p>

<p>
With this, we were able to tailor animation and UX around attractive angles in the underlying photography which is ultimately what creatives want
out of a model.

<p>
Most of our clients were footwear brands seeking a more forward-thinking product presentation. They would send new products to our
studio to be digitized and photographed. We needed to stand up a high-end studio photography setup
