<p>
Arcsine Imaging was a hybrid software-photography studio I started in early 2020 with my good friend Dustin. We built an optimized 3D format for
rendering physical objects the web. Here's a sample:
</p>

<div class="full-width">
  <div class="card">
    <div id="cloudultra-viewer" style="height: 600px; width: 700px;"></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
Before this venture, we had spent six years collectively in the augmented reality space. We we're frustrated by the low fidelity graphics,
awkward wearables, and lack of clear product use-case throughout that industry. We wanted to build something more tangible.
</p>

<p>
We built an embeddable 3D viewer and asset compression pipeline from scratch to support the use dynamically project photo textures.
The idea was to tailor animations and UX around attractive angles in the underlying photography. Creatives often only cared about a few select
viewpoints rather than an entirely physically accurate asset.
</p>

<p>
Most of our clients were footwear brands seeking a more forward-thinking product presentation. They would send new products to our
studio to and we would collaborate on styling / lighting. The resulting model could be embedded into a wide variety of web-based promotional material.
</p>

<p>
We also found great, though less marketable, results with outdoor scenes:
</p>

<div class="full-width">
  <div class="card">
    <div id="poster-wall-viewer" style="height: 600px; width: 700px;"></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
Ultimately, the wide variety of client needs and intricacies of the scanning process stopped us from reaching the level of automation
we'd hoped to achieve. Which is fine, not every piece of tech needs to be universe-scale. We did high-quality work for amazing clients 
I learned an incredible amount about business, product development, and myself over my time at Arcsine.
