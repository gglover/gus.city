<h1>Big English Football Poster</h1>
<div class="time-stamp">NOV 2024</div>

<p>When I was a kid, I really wanted a poster with the badge of every team in the 
{% include external_link.html title='English football league system' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_league_system#The_system' %} on it.
So I decided to make one and share it for free.

<p>I wrote a few python utility scripts to automate the process. Data is sourced from league tables and team pages on Wikipedia.
The scraped HTML is then piped into BeautifulSoup to extract relevant metadata.</p>

<p>To speed up badge layout I wrote a simple HTML / CSS document generator.
The final poster is exported directly from Chrome using the <code>Full size screenshot</code> devtools built-in. This isn't super flexible, but any
final touch-ups can easily be performed by importing the poster into Illustrator.
</p>

<p>This setup makes it mostly painless for me to update the poster for future promotion / relegation cycles.</p>
