<h1>Big English Football Poster</h1>
<div class="time-stamp">NOV 2024</div>

<p>
I thought it would be fun to fit as much of the {% include external_link.html title='English football league system' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_league_system#The_system' %}
as I could onto one poster.
</p>

<p>If you like it, it's easy to get in your own space. Feel free to download your preferred size below, take the file to a print shop, hang it up, and enjoy!</p>

<p>
I wrote a few Python utility scripts to automate the process. Data is sourced from league tables and team pages on Wikipedia.
The scraped HTML is then piped into BeautifulSoup to extract relevant metadata.</p>

<p>
To speed up badge layout, I wrote a simple HTML / CSS document generator.
The final poster is exported directly from Chrome using the <code>Full size screenshot</code> devtools built-in. This isn't super flexible, but any
final touch-ups can easily be performed by importing the poster into Illustrator.
</p>

<p>This setup makes it relatively painless for me to update the poster for future promotion / relegation cycles.</p>

<h2>Previous efforts</h2>

<p>
I made a first attempt at this poster when I was in high school. At the time, I was waking up at 7 AM most weekends to catch West Brom playing.
</p>

<div class="full-width">
  {% include image_card.html src="efl_poster_physical_old.jpg" alt="Large poster with badges from 7 tiers of english football" height="450px" alt="Original poster from 2012" %}
</div>
<p>
Putting this together was a tedious and fully-manual process. Many hours were spent pushing badges around in a huge Photoshop file.
I didn't have the patience to add all the lower tiers. This was the main reason I chose to do so much automation this time around.
