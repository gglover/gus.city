Tony Delivers: the one-man, cult-classic UberEats killer. I helped my friend Tony create the <em>branding</em>, <em>marketing</em>, and <em>website</em> for
his new food delivery service.

Seattle's minimum wage ordinance for gig workers was causing chaos in the market. The apps were finally being forced to fairly compensate their drivers, and 
predictibly, pushed their increased costs straight to customers. People were furious, orders were drying up. It was a stalemate.
</p>

<p>
Tony had been delivering food for the better part of three years and had never seen it this bad. He was on the verge of quitting, but had one last idea.
We got together, talked it out, and I put this poster together:

Yes, it's a little rough around the edges, but maybe that's exactly what makes it work. Flash and polish are just one tool in the bag. I try not to make things more complicated 
than they need to be.

Almost overnight, Tony was slammed with orders. Incredibly, people we're able to order lunch without relying on a billion dollar tech company.
Mdia outlets were eager to pick up on the story:

It was exhilarating to be a part of the public conciousness, even briefly, and help a friend out. A little passion and concentrated effort can take things a long way.
As of November 2024 Tony is still booking orders. He is also working on a documentary and moblie app.
